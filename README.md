# EasyShop
EasyShop is a web application built using Spring Boot, providing a simple and intuitive platform for users to shop and manage products.

# Project Overview
Easy Shop is an already existing e-commerce application for technology and electronics. I was tasked with enhancing the application by fixing bugs that had been reported by users, implementing and editing existing methods, and adding new features.

# Features
User Authentication and Authorization: The application allows users to register, login, and logout, and provides role-based access control to ensure that users can only access features and data that they are authorized to access.
Product management with CRUD operations: The application provides a comprehensive product management system, allowing administrators to create, read, update, and delete products, as well as manage product categories and inventory.
(WIP) - Shopping cart functionality with order management
(WIP) - Simple and intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# Project Structure
The project is structured into the following packages:

org.yearup: The main application package
org.yearup.controllers: Controllers for handling HTTP requests
org.yearup.data: Data access objects (DAOs) for interacting with the database
org.yearup.models: Model classes for representing data entities
org.yearup.security: Security-related classes for authentication and authorization
