Year Up United Java Capstone 3

===========================================================================

# EasyShop
EasyShop is a web application built using Spring Boot, providing a simple and intuitive platform for users to shop and manage products.

# Project Overview
Easy Shop is an e-commerce application for technology and electronics that already exists. I was tasked with enhancing the application by fixing bugs that had been reported by users, implementing and editing existing methods, and adding new features.

# Features
User Authentication and Authorization: The application allows users to register, login, and logout, and provides role-based access control to ensure that users can only access features and data that they are authorized to access.

Product management with CRUD operations: The application provides a comprehensive product management system, allowing administrators to create, read, update, and delete products, as well as manage product categories and inventory.

Work In Progress - Shopping cart functionality with order management

# Project Structure
The project is structured into the following packages:

- org.yearup: The main application package
 
- org.yearup.controllers: Controllers for handling HTTP requests
 
- org.yearup.data: Data access objects (DAOs) for interacting with the database
 
- org.yearup.models: Model classes for representing data entities
 
- org.yearup.security: Security-related classes for authentication and authorization

# Interesting Piece of Code

I chose this piece of code as interesting, because being able to get the products by ID allowed me to execute so many other commands/requests in other areas of the project. It was seemingly simple but more effective results.

# Point of Challenge

I spent a great deal of time working through Postman to get my tests to pass, and correct any and all errors. It's a very helpful guide but a challenging transition from battling errors in IntelliJ. It showed me how in depth work in real world industry would be.

# Future Goals In This Project

In the future I would like to successfully create the shopping cart and its check out capabilities. I will continue to work on mastering the full completeion of this project for a fully functioning store.
